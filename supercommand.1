FILES
       /dev/input/event2
              Default keyboard device path for keylogger functionality

EXAMPLES
       Create a new file:
           supercommand -m 1 1 newfile.txt

       Change file permissions:
           supercommand -m 1 2 filename.txt 0644

       Create a directory:
           supercommand -m 2 1 newdir

       Start keylogger:
           supercommand -m 3 keylog.txt

EXIT STATUS
       0      Success
       1      Invalid arguments or operation failure

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
       The keylogger functionality requires appropriate permissions to access input 
       devices and should be used with caution. The program should be run with 
       appropriate privileges based on the intended operations.

NOTES
       File operations use default permissions of 0644 for new files and 0755 for 
       new directories.
